# Spring Boot Applications & Security

This repository currently contains 2 sample Spring Boot applications that implement REST API functionality, Spring MVC and Data JPA, introduce common application security vulnerabilities, and demonstrate how to prevent the vulnerabilities from occurring.

In the *Walkthroughs* folder there are PDF files that can be viewed inline on GitHub, that go over the steps of the security controls implemented in each project with screenshots, explanations, etc.
